# Hello!
# This file is a placeholder which can be used as a template for categorizing your own art on a JEKETNUNC website.
# The three default folders are "_primary", "_secondary", and "_unlisted".
# You can categorize your art by creating description HTML files (like this template) and placing them into one of these three folders.
# WARNING:
# In the template repository, this "28075.html" file is present in ALL THREE folders. This causes it to show up on all three lists.
# This is only done to introduce the idea of each of the three categories. Your art should only go in one folder at a time.
# This feature was designed with the idea that you might drag-and-drop HTML files from the "_unlisted" directory into "_primary", or from "_primary" into "_secondary".
